Project Description
-------------------
The Market Intelligence division of S&P Global provides annual multiyear forecasts of United States subscribers for the video industry, which is comprised of cable, satellite, and telecommunication service providers. The focus of this project is to explore the application of machine learning methods to these forecasts. We used demographic and subscriber data to assess the accuracy of different models, splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets. These models include support vector regression, artificial neural networks, and tree-based models, namely the traditional random forest and XGBoost. The training and validation sets were used to identify optimal parameters for each model. After identifying these parameters, we compared each model using the held-out testing set. These results indicated that the XGBoost model performed best, with a root mean squared error of 2,712. This initial exploration into machine learning shows promise and indicates it can be used as a tool to enhance S&P’s current forecasting techniques. The industry is continuing to change as new technologies create disruption in the marketplace, which necessitates continued research into forecasting within this field.
